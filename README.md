# Gregle

A static personal homepage and collection of browser tools, served at the domain in `CNAME`.

- `index.html`: search, recent searches, local weather and BBC headlines.
- `weather.html`: Environment Canada forecasts for Vancouver, Victoria and Chilliwack.
- `petrol.html`: fuel-cost calculator with map-based routing.
- `xkcd.html`: comic search using archive titles and context clues.
- `contact.html` and `donate.html`: contact and support pages.

`environment-canada.html` redirects older bookmarks to `weather.html`. `Victoria_weather.html` remains a standalone Victoria forecast page.

## Local preview

No build step or package installation is required. Serve this directory with any static web server, for example:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Weather, headlines, autocomplete, map routing and live comic archives use external services and require network access. Browser storage and clipboard access may be restricted; the pages provide fallbacks for these cases.

## Checks

Run the regression suite with Node.js 18 or newer, without installing dependencies:

```sh
node --test tests/*.test.cjs
```

GitHub Actions runs the suite on pull requests and pushes to `main`. The tests exercise inline JavaScript with small DOM and service doubles, covering escaping, stored data, asynchronous requests, routing, forecasts, wallet copying and local icon paths. They do not verify the availability of live external services or replace browser checks.

## Adding a tool

Add your HTML page, then copy a `.tool-card` in `links.html` and update its URL, title, description and icon. The homepage **Tools** menu item opens this directory. `links.html`, `xkcd.html` and `petrol.html` share `assets/tools.css` and `assets/theme.js`, including the existing `gregle-theme` preference. The fuel calculator adds its page layout in `assets/fuel.css`.

## Refreshing the xkcd index

The browser searches `data/xkcd-index.json` on this site, avoiding cross-origin archive requests and third-party proxies. The checked-in snapshot includes all official titles through the recorded `latest` comic, excluding xkcd’s deliberately missing #404. It is a title index with selected context clues, not a full-transcript index.

To include newly published comics, run this with Python 3.10+ and curl, then commit the updated JSON:

```sh
python3 scripts/update_xkcd_index.py
```

The updater reads the official archive and latest-comic JSON, decodes HTML entities, and refuses to overwrite the existing index if comic IDs are missing or inconsistent. The page shows the index date and latest comic; **Reload index** fetches the copy currently deployed on Gregle. New comics appear after an updated index is committed and deployed.

The parser has separate offline checks:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
```
